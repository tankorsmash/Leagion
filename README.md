## Webpack Setup

Install node modules:

    npm install

Run the webpack devserver which will watch and compile all jsx files when they are changed.
It will also hot reload, so eany time you make a change to a jsx file, you don't have to reload the page to get the changes, it will change automatically for you.

    npm start
